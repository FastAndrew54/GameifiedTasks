# GameifiedTasks
this code allows you to assign points to tasks
then after you are finished entering all tasks you can enter stop
the program will then prompt you to enter the name of the task that you are looking for
if you have already completed the task or if you have not added it to begin with it will tell you that the task either does not exist
or has already been completed. you can enter POINTS to get the total ammount of points accumulated.
And once all tasks are completed the task will automatically end
